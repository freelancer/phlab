Custom extensions for Phabricator.

= Development =
The best way to develop Phlab is to use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) locally by running `docker-compose up` from the root of the repository. Before doing so, you should have the following repositories cloned locally, in the same parent directory as Phlab itself:

  - [Arcanist](https://github.com/phacility/arcanist)
  - [libphutil](https://github.com/phacility/libphutil)
  - [Phabricator](https://github.com/phacility/phabricator)
